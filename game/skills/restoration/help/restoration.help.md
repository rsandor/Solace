# Skill: Restoration (vit/mag)
The `restoration` skill allows players to cast spells that restore health and
stamina, and provides protective buffs that mitigate damage.

While originally thought to be given by the gods, the school of restoration
was found by scholars to have roots in pure magic outside the realm of the
divine. It is rumored that a book of mastery exists on the subject that
contains the ultimate secrets of the craft.

## Passive Enhancements:
The following passive enhancements are granted by the restoration skill at the
given skill levels:

* [Level 75] `Mass Effect`
  The following cooldowns now effect all players in the target's party when
  used: `Heal`, `Refresh`, `Shield`, `Protect`, and `Regenerate`.

## Cooldown Actions:
The following spells are granted by the restoration skill at the given skill
levels:

* [Level 5] `Heal` (GCD, 2s cast, 10% MP)
  The heal spell heals a target's HP by 10-20% (scales with skill level).
* [Level 15] `Refresh` (GCD, 2s cast, 10% MP)
  The refresh spell heals a target's SP by 10-20% (scales with skill level).

  with skill level).
