# Skill: Unarmored (spe/str)
The unarmored skill allows the character to effectively defend against attacks
when wearing little or no armor.

## Passive Enhancements:
The unarmored skill provides the following passive enhancements when a character
wears no equipment that constitutes as light or heavy armor:

* [Level 10] `Dodge`
  The character has a 5% to 15% chance of dodging an incoming attack entirely
  (chance increases with skill level).
* [Level 25] `Steel Skin`
  The character gains comparable (though lessened) AC from wearing head, body,
  and hands equipment that is neither light nor heavy armor. Further, they are
  granted an additional 1% to 5% resistance to bludgeoning (resistance scales
  based on skill level).
* [Level 35] `Low Guard`
  The character gains comparable (though lessened) AC from wearing legs and
  waist that is neither light nor heavy armor. Further, they are granted an
  additional 1% to 5% resistance to slashing (resistance scales based on skill
  level).
* [Level 45] `Fast Footwork`
  The character gains comparable (though lessened) AC from wearing feet
  equipment that is neither light nor heavy armor. Further, they are granted a
  1% to 10% success bonus when fleeing battle (bonus scales based on skill
  level).

  cooldown actions that require time to cast or enact.

  are not considered light or heavy armor.

  reduced by 20% or 1 second (whichever is higher).
