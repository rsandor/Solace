# Skill: Conjuration (str/mag)
The `conjuration` skill allows players to cast spells that summon items and
beings into the game world.

Considered the queen of the magical arts, conjuration was the first school to
truly bring forth the power of magic unto the world. Dedicated, albeit
"highbrow," schools of conjuration have existed for many centuries and
continue to persist into this age of adventure. For those not of noble birth
wishing to enter such schools and glean the true nature of planar reality, a
steep fee is said to be required.

## Passive Enhancements:
The following passive enhancements are granted by the conjuration skill at the
given skill levels:

* [Level 50] `Elemental Manipulator`
  Unlocks `advanced pet actions` for summoned elemental pets.
* [Level 75] `Greater Elementals`
  Summoned elemental pets gain a 20% bonus to AC, attack roll, and an
  additional attack.

## Cooldown Actions:
The following spells are granted by the necromancy skill at the given skill
levels:

* [level 5] `Summon Elemental` (120s cooldown, 15s cast, 25% MP)
  The player draws upon magical energies to open a portal to the elemental
  planes and draw out an elemental. Based on skill level, four types of
  elementals can be summoned at will:

    [ 5] `Fire Elemental` - The primary offense pet, the fire elemental
         supplements its attacks with fire magic.
    [15] `Earth Elemental` - A defense oriented pet, the earth elemental has
         a special knack for drawing enemy attacks.
    [25] `Lightning Elemental` - Average defense and offense; the lightning
         elemental can apply debuffs that confuse, damage, and hinder enemies.
    [35] `Water Elemental` - Average defense and offense; the water elemental
         can cast buffs that help the caster and their party.

  Each type can be summoned at the discretion of the caster and then becomes
  a pet that follows the caster and performs and special `pet actions` it is
  given. The mobile pet has the same level as the caster and that level scales
  as long as the pet is summoned.

* [Level 10] `Sustenance` (9s cooldown, 2s cast, 5% MP)
  The character summons a full waterskin and three loaves of bread.
* [Level 30] `Mend Elements` (6s cooldown, 2s cast, 12% MP)
  Restores 10-20% of a summoned elemental pet's HP.
* [Level 55] `Resonance` (30s cooldown, 6s cast, 30% MP)
  The target gains the `resonating` debuff for 10-60s. The debuff deals 20-60
  potency force damage damage every 2 seconds and they also become vulnerable
  to the damage type element of any summoned pet at the time of casting.
* [Level 80] `Absorb` (240s cooldown, instant, free)
  The caster aborbs the energy of their summoned elemental instantly healing
  80% of their MP. The elemental is consumed and dies as a result.
* [Level 95] `Meld` (160s cooldown, 8s cast, 75% MP)
  The caster melds minds with her element and gleans unknown truths of its
  home plane. After a the spell completes they open a direct gate to an
  energy flow on that plane directed at a target, dealing 1600 potency damage
  of the damage type for the summoned elemental.
